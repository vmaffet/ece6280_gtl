there where it is we do not need the wall
he is all pine and i am apple orchard
my apple trees will never get across
and eat the cones under his pines i tell him
he only says good fences make good neighbors
spring is the mischief in me and i wonder
if i could put a notion in his head
why do they make good neighbors isnt it
where there are cows but here there are no cows
before i built a wall id ask to know
what i was walling in or walling out
and to whom i was like to give offense
something there is that doesnt love a wall
that wants it down i could say elves to him
but its not elves exactly and id rather
he said it for himself i see him there
bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
in each hand like an old stone savage armed
he moves in darkness as it seems to me
not of woods only and the shade of trees
he will not go behind his fathers saying
and he likes having thought of it so well
he says again good fences make good neighbors
